# n8n-nodes-excel-writer

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Excel file manipulation in your n8n workflows.

This node enables you to write text, JSON objects, and insert images into `.xlsx` Excel files using the `exceljs` and `sharp` libraries, entirely in memory. It's ideal for automated report generation, templated document filling, and embedding media into spreadsheets.

[n8n](https://n8n.io) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
