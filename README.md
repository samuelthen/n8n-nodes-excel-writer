# n8n-nodes-excel-writer

This is an n8n community node that allows you to **write text, JSON objects, and images into Excel files** as part of your workflows.

It uses the powerful [`exceljs`](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) and [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) libraries to dynamically edit `.xlsx` files in memory ‚Äî no external services required.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

|------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `excelField`     | string  | Binary field name that contains the Excel file (default: `data`)           |

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ n8n `v1.60.0+`
- ‚úÖ Fully tested on `v1.64.3`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Node must receive a valid `.xlsx` binary file

---

## Usage Tips

- Use `Read Binary File` or `HTTP Request (Response: file)` to load your `.xlsx` file into the binary field.
- For images, use nodes like `Read Binary File`, `Move Binary Data`, or `Webhook` with `Binary` input.
- `dataField` is overloaded by design to accept either:
  - A **JSON key** (for text and JSON writing)
  - A **binary field name** (for image insertion)
